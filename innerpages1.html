    <p>Well, that’s a very easy and a very difficult point to explain. If I simply say that I love you toooo much then
      how much is toooo much? As much as the stars in the sky !? As much as the fishes in the sea !? Or as much as the ants in the jungle!?
      Let me not quantify it this way because its too less.
      <br/>
      I love you to a point ( and beyond ) where I want to spend every moment with you, see you happy and be with you. Even in the
      toughest of times, I don’t want to stop being there for you. If the happiest times of my life are not shared with you then I wont
      consider them as the happiest.<br /> And that is how much I love you ❤
