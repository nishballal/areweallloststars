    <p>Vinay, you are a persistent person and I know you have put in a lot of hard work before bringing this thought
      in your mind. Just, close your eyes and take a really deep breathe. Think about the beginning of this situation
      and try to remember
      why you started. Is that reason still important to you? Do you have a better approach to get ‘there’? Is that really a
      better approach? Talk about all this to yourself before taking up the next step you are thinking to take.<br>
      If you are still not feeling good, just remember that you are not a ‘give-up-er’. You are a ‘go-get-er’. You don’t have
      to think this through. Just accept it as a fact! There is nothing in this world that you cannot do. Things may take time but they
      will happen for sure. Give it some time. Take a break. Start over from where it went off. Think of It as your game.
      You have great support, skills, energy and plan. You are going to win. Just stick with it.
